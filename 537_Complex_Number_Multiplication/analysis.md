## Manipulate with string and stream

### Naive solution needs to find out the index of "+" and "-" and then do the string manipulation.

- Even this is very important and needs to master the method of string!
Note that the ```string``` is used with ```""``` while ```char``` is used with ```''```
- ```stoi``` is used with only positive number
- ```to_string``` is for int to string


### Best solution is very advanced!

- Use a char buff to filter the sign of "+" and "-"
- Use int variable to read in the ints!
