### TODO
Need to add a "keyword" feature of readme file so that you can quickly review the things you have learnt.
e.g, 771: set, unordered_set, initialize

### Why this project?
---
1. Practice the data structure and algorithm for C++ (may learn java)

2. Not only get a true solution, but also OPTIMIZE memory and speed

3. Crack the interview

4. Learn git and other stuff

5. Just cool
### How?
---
1. Sort the [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems by acceptance

2. Figure out an intuitive solution, without considering time and memory

3. Figure out a better solution that requires less complexity and compare them

4. Check the discussion section and see how the best answer does

5. Close the discussion and do it again!

6. Take down codes and notes for that problem, and push to this project!

### Details about taking notes
---
1. Why I got wrong? (if necessary)

2. Complexity analysis, if necessary

3. Syntax (like initialization, compare function and so on)

4. Use key words so that convenient to review!


Reference to this good [template](https://github.com/illuz/leetcode)

Note that codes cannot run locally. Should copy and paste on leetcode and run.
